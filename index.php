      WHY WAS THE FOUNDATION STARTED?
    </div>

    <div class="home-foundation-right">
      Many people don't recognize that depression is a disease and often see depression as a weakness or something that they should be able to fix on their own. Depression is a disease like any other, and, if left untreated, can have devastating consequences. The <strong>Charles E. Kubly Foundation</strong> was founded in 2003 after the death of Charlie Kubly. Friends and family members of Charlie saw a need in the community for services to address depression and suicide prevention.<br>
